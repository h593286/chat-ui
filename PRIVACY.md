## Privacy
### Authentication

We use **FEIDE** through **Microsoft Entra** for authentication. This process requires access to basic FEIDE personal information, including your name, email, and profile picture. This information is essential for creating and managing your user account.

### Chat Data

Your messages are stored in a **secure** chat database. This allows us to provide you with a complete chat history and to perform non-identifiable analysis (see the Analysis section below). You can delete your conversations at any time—individually or all at once—by navigating to *"Settings"* and selecting *"Delete all conversations."*

### Analysis

Periodically, message logs are processed to remove identifiers (except for timestamps and raw text). These anonymized logs are sent to the Azure OpenAI GPT model for analysis. This analysis determines the course topics being discussed and the nature of the conversations (e.g., whether they involve quizzing, coding, etc.).
The aggregated insights are shared with teachers to help them stay informed as more questions are directed to chatbots instead of instructors. Importantly, this analysis is non-identifiable and focuses on overall trends for the class, not on individual users.

### Cookies

Cookies are used to enhance your experience by saving session states and preferences. This ensures ease of use, such as not requiring you to log in repeatedly.
